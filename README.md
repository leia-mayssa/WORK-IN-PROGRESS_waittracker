struggling with *overwaitness??? meet waittracker: your personal wait trainer that listens in and keeps count of how many times you say "wait". wait no more—start your wait-loss journey today!!

***o·ver·wait·ness** /ˌoʊvərˈweɪtnəs/ _noun._
a speech-pattern disorder characterized by an abnormally excessive verbalization of the word "wait", despite no actual waiting being required

## Web Speech API & compatibility
waittracker utilizes the browser's Web Speech API to detect the word "wait" in real time. all audio stays in the browser and never leaves the device.

implications on compatibility:
- desktop (chrome/edge): optimal experience
- android: functional with inconsistencies due to limitations of continuous speech recognition
- ios: not supported due to lack of speech recognition support

## acknowledgements
credits to my friends whose struggles with overwaitness inspired this project <3
